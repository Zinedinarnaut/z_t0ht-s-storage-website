``` 
cd api
npm i or npm install
npm start
```
```
cd client 
npm i or npm install
npm start
```

Everything runs on node v12

api runs on port 4001
website runs on port 3000 which you can change

Note: this will only work for pc as it's a Draggable file/folder manager but I'll add a button for phone users.
